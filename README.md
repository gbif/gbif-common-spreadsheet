# GBIF Common (Spreadsheet)

This library extends [gbif-common](https://github.com/gbif/gbif-common) to read OpenDocument
and OOXML spreadsheets (commonly associated with LibreOffice and Microsoft Excel respectively)
in the same way as that library reads delimited text (CSV, TSV etc).

## To build the project
```
mvn clean install
```

## Note on Jackson 2

This project uses the shaded Jackson 2 library from `gbif-common`.
